# Random mod

Just a mod that adds random stuff. Used on a private server.

Modifications:

- Adds a `/head` command to wear anything on your head
- Makes creepers unable to destroy blocks (their explosions still do damage)
- Farmland no longer is destroyed when jumping on it
- Food items have random body part names
